1. Add below dependancy in consumer service. 		

		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-openfeign</artifactId>
			<version>2.2.5.RELEASE</version>
		</dependency>

2. Create Client controller along with request mapping which we want to consume : 

	Ex : @GetMapping("/get")
	     public String deliveryRequest()
	     {
		return "This is delivery request...";
	     }

3. In application.properties of both services, add port number along with application name.

4. In consumer service, ensure spring version is "2.3.5. RELEASE" or else it will give configuration properties error.

5. Now create one interface within service package where we will define our required service url using below sub steps  : 
	i. Annotate interface with : 
		@FeignClient(name = "Delivery", url = "http://localhost:9999/") // Delivery is application name, url = require different 											service url

	ii. Now define abstract method as : 
		@GetMapping("/getDelivery/get")
		public String deliveryRequest(); 
			// This is required different service url from controller..

6. Now autowired Step 5 interface in consumer controller and call its abstract method within consumer request url.

6. Enable feign client using below annotation in main spring class : 
	@EnableFeignClients

7. Now start both the services simulataneously and hit consumer url and required url response will get.
