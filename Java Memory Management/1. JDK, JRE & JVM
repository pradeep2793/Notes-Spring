JDK : 
	1. JDK stands for Java Development Kit.
	2. JDK provide development tools(programs/softwares) and execution/runtime environment.
	3. JDK is used for developing new application and modiffying existing applications.
	4. With the help of JDK, application gets compiled and converted to bytecode which is used on client machine to run.
	5. So, JDK contains development tool compiler and runtime environment JVM.

JRE :
	1. JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
	2. It provide only Runtime environment not development tools.
	3. Using JRE, we can only execute already developed application and cannot run or developed new application and cannot modify existing application.
	4. JRE is platform dependent.

JVM : 
	1. JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
	2. It contains Interpreter+JIT, responsible to load and run java bytecode by converting bytecode into current OS machine language.
	3. Interpreter is used for executing line by line execution
	4. JIT stands for Just in Time compiler, it increases the performance of conversion of bytecode into current os language.
