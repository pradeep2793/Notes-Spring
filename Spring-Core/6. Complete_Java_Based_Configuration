I) Delete the xml config file.

II) create new java class wherein configuration is to be done, mark the class as @Configuration and @ComponentScan(basePackages="")
	Example : 
		@Configuration
		@ComponentScan(basePackages = "com.spring.practise")
		public class LivingThingConfig {

			// fetch the value of data member using @Value from properties file.		

		}

III) Later on mark classes @Component whose object or bean need to be created and @Autowired of whose object or bean need to be injected.

IV) In app.java
	 ApplicationContext ctx =  new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(LivingThingConfig.class);

V) Done.....!!
