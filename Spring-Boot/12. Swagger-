	To ease this process, swagger is used through which documentation process is automated.  It enables documentation to be updated at the same pace as the server.
	When properly defined via Swagger, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic. Thus Swagger removes the guesswork in calling the service.

2. Thus, we will use springfox swagger 2.

3. Create rest controller and few urls and check and verify in postman weather all urls are working.

4. Now add following dependancy for swagger 2

	<!-- It will create swagger document in json format -->
		<dependency>
			<groupId>io.springfox</groupId>
			<artifactId>springfox-swagger2</artifactId>
			<version>2.9.2</version>
		</dependency>

		<!-- It provide readable document format i.e., in html instead of json and allow to interact api's urls-->
		<dependency>
			<groupId>io.springfox</groupId>
			<artifactId>springfox-swagger-ui</artifactId>
			<version>2.9.2</version>
		</dependency>

5. Now goto core spring boot application java file, add annotation as : @EnableSwagger2

6. Now annotate controller with some url as Ex : "@RequestMapping("/v2")", so that it will biforcate with root url in order to ensure all url to work properly..

7. Now json documentaion url is : http://localhost:8080/v2/api-docs
	Html response : http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html   (no need of using /v2 url)
