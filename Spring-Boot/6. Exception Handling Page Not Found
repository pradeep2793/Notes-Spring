1. Create one new controller handling exception only : 

	@Controller("error")
	public class ErrorController {
	
	@ExceptionHandler(Exception.class)
	public ModelAndView errorHandler(HttpServletRequest req, Exception ex)
	{
		ModelAndView mv = new ModelAndView();
		mv.addObject("url", req.getRequestURL());
		mv.addObject("error", ex.getStackTrace());
		
		mv.setViewName("error");
		return mv;
	}

2. Above "ex.getStackTrace()" can be logged in loggers as well along with "req.getRequestURL()" so that support team will be able to find out exactly what has occurs.

3. Create error.jsp and give constant message as "Some exception occured. Connect with support team..!!"
